Documentation For The Edam Browser Logo

I created a logo for the Edam ontology which I feel fits its core.
Having a great logo is one of the most important things for a good brand
and one that wants to attract lots of visibility. Edam been so large and big on 
medicine is a great fit to give this platform for contributions.
I believe aesthetics is a great part of making one feel better and
in medicine, this is the desire of every medical practitioner.
Having an amazing logo sets your brand apart and gives users good
memories which subsequently makes them refer others to that experience.
