### Contributions

##### pull requests

The recommended way for new contributors to submit code to EDAM Browser is to fork the repository on GitHub and then submit a pull request after committing the changes. We will then need to approve the request by the core developers before it is merged into the main repository.

The contributed code will be **licensed under EDAM Browser's license**,
https://github.com/IFB-ElixirFr/edam-browser/blob/master/LICENSE 
If you did not write the code yourself, you ensure the existing
license is compatible and include the license information in the
contributed files, or obtain a permission from the original
author to relicense the contributed code.
