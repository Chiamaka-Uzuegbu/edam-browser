### Contributions

##### Pull requests

The recommended way for new contributors to submit code to EDAM Browser is to fork the repository on GitHub and then submit a pull request after committing the changes. The maintainers will then review the request before it is merged into the main branch.

The contributed code will be **licensed under EDAM Browser's license**,
https://github.com/edamontology/edam-browser/blob/main/LICENSE 
If you did not write the code yourself, you ensure the existing
license is compatible and include the license information in the
contributed files, or obtain a permission from the original
author to relicense the contributed code.
